####General Information
Commix (short for [comm]and [i]njection e[x]ploiter) has a simple environment and it can be used, from web developers, penetration testers or even security researchers to test web applications with the view to find bugs, errors or vulnerabilities related to command injection attacks. By using this tool, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or string. Commix is written in Python programming language.

####Disclaimer
The tool is only for testing and academic purposes and can only be used where strict consent has been given. Do not use it for illegal purposes!!

####Requirements
[Python](http://www.python.org/download/) version **2.6.x** or **2.7.x** is required for running this program.

####Installation
Download commix by cloning the Git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/stasinopoulos/commix.git commix

Commix comes packaged on the official repositories of the following Linux distributions, so you can use the package manager to install it!

- [ArchAssault](https://archassault.org/)
- [BlackArch](http://blackarch.org/)

Commix also comes pre-installed, on the following penetration testing frameworks:
- [The Penetration Testers Framework (PTF)](https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf)
- [PentestBox](https://tools.pentestbox.com/)
- [Weakerthan](http://www.weaknetlabs.com/)
- [CTF-Tools](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools)
